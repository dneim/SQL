This project explored data for the hotel industry. SSMS was used to cleanse the data and to add aggregate columns for later visualization.

Post cleansing, the data was imported into Power BI, and a dashboard was created to show general trends in hotel revenue across dates and 
hotel types, as well as a breakdown revenue and required parking metrics for each year.
