This project focuses on data cleansing techniques.

Dataset: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx

The project specifically focused on:
1. How to obtain address data present in other rows for rows that were missing a valid address. 
2. Splitting addresses into relevant columns for later use
3. Updating Boolean values to clear 'Yes' / 'No' strings
4. Remving duplicates, and dropping unused columns
