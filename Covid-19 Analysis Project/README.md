This was my first project using both SSMS [data cleasning] and Tableau [visualization]

Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Part 1 of the project involved using SQl to isolate the data points to be used in later visualizations. THis code is contained in 'Death_Data_Exploration.sql'.
Additional analysis was performed on testing and vaccination numbers, whcih can be found in 'Vax_Data_Exploration'.

Part 2 of the project involved transferring the query data from 'Death_Data_Exploration.sql' into excel sheets that were then imported into Tableau.
The dashboard assoicated with this project can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.neiman1150/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_16727191206430/Dashboard1
